# The Social Thinking Api

## Description
This challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to other thoughts, and create a friend list. The Social Network API provides endpoints to create users, retrieve user information, update user data, delete users, manage friends, create thoughts, retrieve thoughts, update thoughts, and delete thoughts. The API is built using Express.js, MongoDB a NoSQl database and Mongoose ODM, an object modeling tool for MongoDB and Node.js, that defines data models and schemas for data to fit into, while also abstracting access to MongoDB so ensuring all saved documents share a structure and contain required properties.


## Installation

- Navigate to Project Directory
  
- Install dependencies:
  ```run npm install```
